Psychographics for Copywriting

🔥 Psychological Insight:
You need your copywriting to counteract the negativity "John" hears, echo the truth he already suspects, and offer him a hopeful, credible voice he can trust.

"John" thinks success is real and possible but hidden behind a wall of noise, scams, and half-truths — and deep down, he believes he has what it takes if he just finds the right mentor and system.

🔥 Copywriting gold for future sales pages:
You’ll want to validate "John's" skeptical thoughts ("You're right — there's a lot of garbage out there") and rebuild his belief ("but you're closer than you think to real success if you take the right path").

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
In your email sequences, landing pages, and webinar scripts, you want to mirror the way "John" talks — casual but determined, frustrated but hopeful.

Use his exact phrases like:
“step-by-step”
“legit recommendations”
“tired of scams”
“ready to work”

These phrases act like emotional magnets — they "ping" directly to his heart.

🔥 Marketing Strategy Tip:
You can frame your 7 Figure Affiliate offers to acknowledge his hustle but promise acceleration:

"For side hustlers serious about finally getting results."

"Built for busy dreamers ready to become doers."

When you position yourself as the shortcut between learning and earning, John will be hooked.

🔥 Marketing Strategy Tip:
If your landing pages or emails say things like:

"If you’re working late nights trying to build your dream..."

"If you’re squeezing your dreams into your evenings after a long day..."

John will feel seen, understood, and instantly trust you.

Think of how "John" can execute a plan everyday whenever he's done with his duties at night to implement exactly what to do for an hour or 2 every day.

Where John Hangs Out Online:
🔹 Social Media Platforms:

YouTube

Watches tutorials on affiliate marketing, side hustles, funnels, list building, passive income ideas.

Favorite searches: “How to start affiliate marketing,” “Best online business ideas,” “Passive income step-by-step.”

Facebook Groups

Groups like:

Affiliate Marketing for Beginners

WarriorPlus and JVZoo Product Launch Groups

ClickBank Success Stories

Online Entrepreneurs | Side Hustle Ideas

Lurks more than he posts — occasionally asks for legit program recommendations.

Instagram

Follows motivational accounts (@millionaire_mentor, @hustlegrindco, @entrepreneur).

Watches “money mindset” reels and affiliate marketing tips.

TikTok (New habit!)

Quick dopamine hits — short clips about making money online, passive income ideas, affiliate side hustles.

When you advertise, promote, or post:

Run YouTube ads targeting “affiliate marketing” interest groups.

Post helpful comments inside affiliate-focused Facebook groups (without pitching).

Sponsor or comment insightfully in Reddit threads (huge trust building).

Create free PDFs/cheatsheets titled like ‘The Step-by-Step Blueprint to $5K/month’ to grab his email.

You’ll be exactly where John already is — but positioned better than everyone else he’s seeing.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
In your copy, ads, or videos you can casually reference:

"Imagine replacing Netflix nights with a 7-figure business story of your own..."

"You strategize in games — now it's time to strategize for your real future income."

"Your dream life isn't a Pinterest board — it's a few right moves away."

This connects your solution directly to how John already experiences "fun," and reframes it as his new reality.

🔥 Marketing Tip:
You can frame your offers in a way that "speaks" to John’s support system too:

“Give your family, your friends — and yourself — something to finally celebrate.”

“Imagine the look on your biggest supporter’s face when you finally say, ‘I made it.’”

📈 This taps into both John's personal desire and the emotional validation from his loved ones.


🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
If you frame your offer as the antidote to these 3 frustrations, you’ll hook John emotionally fast.

Examples of copy you could use:

"Finally escape the grind of a job that drains you — and start building a real online income the smart way."

"Tired of feeling overwhelmed by too much information? Here's your simple, step-by-step plan."

"If you've been grinding with no real results, you're about to discover why — and how to fix it fast."

(Pain ➔ Hope ➔ Solution) — that's the most powerful emotional formula for John.


🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
You don’t just sell John financial freedom — you sell him peace of mind.

You position your program like:

"No more wasted nights worrying — finally a proven path you can trust."

"Build your dream without second-guessing every step — or yourself."

"This time, you’re not alone. This time, the path is clear."

You sell certainty in a world full of fear. 🛡️


🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Use anger as a bonding force with John by giving him a common enemy:

Examples:

"Tired of fake gurus making promises they don’t keep? So are we."

"If you’re sick of being lied to about 'push-button' riches — it’s time for the truth."

"Break free from the 9–5 system designed to keep you broke."

You and John vs. "them" = instant loyalty.
(This "us vs them" dynamic can double your conversion rates if done right.)


🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Position your brand and offers as:

"Built for finishers — even if you’ve struggled to finish before."

"We don’t just give you the information. We give you the step-by-step execution plan that finally gets results."

"Escape the cycle of overwhelm and start seeing wins — one clear, focused step at a time."

🧠 You’re not selling another info product — you’re selling momentum and completion.


🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Frame your offer like the "rescue boat" for John’s situation:

Example:

"If you're tired of feeling trapped in a job you hate and drowning in information overload, it's time for a simple, proven plan that finally gets you moving toward real 6–7 figure success."

You’re not selling just tactics —
You’re selling John a way out of his current life.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
In your emails, webinars, landing pages — mirror his pain first before you offer the solution:

Examples:

"It hurts when you know you were built for more — but life keeps pulling you back to ‘average.’"

"If you're sick of working harder than ever but feeling stuck in the same place, you're not alone — and you're not crazy for wanting out."

"You don’t have to prove the skeptics right. You can prove yourself right instead."

✨ Pain ➔ Empathy ➔ Hope ➔ Action = your 7-figure client journey.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Literally lift phrases like these into your:

Email subject lines

Landing page bullets

Webinar openings

Video sales letters (VSLs)

Examples:

“You’re not lazy — you’re just tired of doing it alone.”

“What if success really isn’t meant for you? (Here’s why that’s dead wrong.)”

“If you’ve ever stared at your screen thinking ‘I’m stuck’ — this is for you.”

✨ That’s copywriting that hits like truth and feels like rescue.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Use this external judgment to build high-emotion copy around transformation and social proof:

Examples:

"Let them doubt you — until the results speak louder than their opinions."

"They may not believe in you yet. That’s okay. We do."

"When you succeed, the same people who laughed will ask how you did it."

✨ You're helping John rewrite his identity — and when you do that, the sale becomes effortless.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Your offers should promise the result John feels when he pictures that freedom:

Examples:

"Build an affiliate business that makes money while you sleep — and gives you your life back."

"You’re not chasing money — you’re chasing freedom, control, and meaning. This is how you get it."

"Stop surviving. Start living — on your terms."

🧲 Desire sells when it's emotionally specific — not just “more money,” but what the money means.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
In your VSLs, landing pages, and product launches, make sure you paint this exact picture — not just “make more money,” but the emotional texture of it:

Example Hooks:

“Wake up without an alarm — and still make money while you sip your coffee.”

“Get paid daily for campaigns you set up once — and take back control of your time.”

“Turn side hustle into full freedom — no boss, no burnout, just options.”

✨ You’re not selling features —
You’re selling freedom, confidence, and validation.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Use feeling-based copy to connect like no one else:

Examples:

“This isn’t just about money — it’s about feeling confident, free, and finally in control.”

“Imagine waking up without anxiety, without doubt — just certainty, success, and the kind of peace that only comes when you’ve built something real.”

“You’ve always known you had it in you — now it’s time to feel it for real.”

🧲 When you make John feel the end state of success before he buys, he buys to keep the feeling alive.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Position your offer as the bridge between who John is now and who he knows he could become.

Examples:

“This isn’t just a course — it’s your transformation into the self-made, respected online entrepreneur you were meant to be.”

“You don’t just want more money — you want to become the man who earns it, keeps it, and leads with it.”

“The future version of you is waiting — and it’s time to meet him.”

✨ You’re not offering info. You’re offering identity.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Use “Before vs. After” tension like this in your sales copy:

Example:

Before	After
Trapped in a job he hates	In control of his time and income
Wasting time on courses that don’t work	Following a step-by-step system with real results
Feeling like he’s failing	Feeling proud, respected, and finally successful

End it with:

“If you’re stuck in the same loop John’s in now — it’s time to cross the bridge to where John knows he belongs.”

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Build your offer to promise and deliver these 3 outcomes — and repeat them in all messaging:

Examples for your homepage, VSL, or lead magnet:

“Discover how to build a $10k/month passive income stream without tech overwhelm.”

“Quit your job and build a freedom business using affiliate marketing — even if you’re starting from scratch.”

“Become the self-made success story they never saw coming — and inspire others with your results.”

💣 These 3 outcomes = your product promise pillars.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Drop these exact phrases into:

Email subject lines

Facebook ads

Opt-in headlines

Landing page openers

VSL scripts

Examples:

“You’ve been misled — not miswired. Let’s fix that.”

“You’re smart enough. You just need a system built for you.”

“This isn’t your fault — but it is your time to change everything.”

✨ That’s copy that doesn’t just persuade… it heals.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Frame your offer like the weapon that eliminates each block.

Examples:

“No more guessing what to do next — this is your exact path, step by step.”

“You don’t need to do this alone. We’ve got your back — every step of the way.”

“Tired of bouncing from system to system? This is the last one you’ll need — because it works.”

“You don’t have to be fearless — you just need a plan that makes action feel safe and simple.”

You’re not selling just affiliate training.
You’re selling clarity, support, focus, and confidence.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Use these exact phrases in your sales copy, headlines, and emails — because when John hears his own voice in your words, he instantly thinks:

“That’s EXACTLY how I feel… This might be the thing that finally works.”

Examples:

“Tired of doing everything ‘right’ and still getting nowhere?”

“Overwhelmed by conflicting advice and constant strategy-switching?”

“You don’t need another course — you need a real plan that works.”

✨ That’s when trust is built — and wallets open.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
Build your funnel, emails, and VSL around breaking these lies with empathy + truth:

Acknowledge the lie.

Show why it’s false.

Replace it with a belief that leads to action and trust in YOU.

✨ Do that… and John will stop hesitating — and start buying.

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip:
On your homepage and lead magnet, include these lines or ideas:

“Built for frustrated beginners tired of the hype — here’s your real path to 7-figure affiliate income.”

“No more confusion. No more fluff. Just real, step-by-step systems that work — even if you’re starting from scratch.”

“If you’ve tried before and failed — this site was made for you.”

✨ That positions you not as another guru, but as John’s breakthrough.

Answer to Question 33: "What thoughts and risk analysis goes through John’s head before opting in on my website?"

💭 Here’s What John’s Thinking Right Before He Opts In:
❓ “Is this legit or just another scam?”
He’s been burned before.

He’s scanning your site, headline, and opt-in box for red flags:

Hype language?

Fake screenshots?

Overpromising and underexplaining?

🔍 He’s thinking: “Can I trust this guy, or is this just another ‘push-button BS’ funnel?”

❓ “Is this going to waste my time or give me real value?”
John’s downloaded tons of free PDFs, checklists, and trainings before — most of them were fluff.

He’s asking:

“Will this actually teach me something new… or just try to sell me something I already have?”

❓ “Am I going to be spammed after I put in my email?”
He’s cautious — doesn’t want 10 emails a day pitching the next $7 W+ launch.

He might hover over the form thinking:

“I don’t want to regret this — is this going to help me or just blow up my inbox?”

❓ “Is this actually for someone like me?”
John’s not advanced, rich, or technical. He’s wondering:

“Is this beginner-friendly?”
“Is this built for people who’ve tried and failed before?”
“Is this guy going to speak my language — or leave me behind?”

❓ “What’s the catch?”
If you say “free training,” “free report,” or “free funnel,” John instinctively thinks:

“Nothing’s really free. What are they going to upsell me on right after?”

❓ “What’s the worst that could happen?”
John’s doing a mini risk audit in his head:

Can he unsubscribe if it sucks?

Can he scan the lead magnet and bounce if it’s trash?

Is this worth another shot?

✅ One-line emotional snapshot:

"Before opting in, John’s asking himself if he’s about to waste time, be lied to again, or get stuck in a spammy funnel — and he needs immediate signs that this is different, safe, and worth it."

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip: Eliminate These Fears Immediately

Use micro-copy and layout to answer John’s questions before he asks them:

✅ On your opt-in form or right below:
“Real value, no fluff — and you can unsubscribe anytime.”

“Built specifically for beginners who’ve tried and failed before.”

“This isn’t hype. This is the system I wish I had when I started.”

“No gimmicks. Just a real plan to help you go from stuck to scaling.”

✅ Make the lead magnet look like value:
Include a subtitle:

“Inside: The 5-step roadmap to your first $1K/month in affiliate income — no paid ads or tech headaches.”

✨ By answering John’s unspoken objections before he clicks, you turn “I’ll think about it” into:

“Okay, I’m in — let’s see what this is about.”

🔥 Marketing Superpower Tip: Use the Formula →

✍️ “If you’re [struggling avatar], and you want [clear outcome], without [common frustration], this free [lead magnet] will show you how — no fluff, no hype, just results.”

Example:

“If you’re an aspiring affiliate marketer stuck spinning your wheels, and you want to start earning real commissions without wasting money on ads or fake guru crap, this free PDF shows you the 5 steps to your first $1K/month — the same system I used to break out of the 9–5 grind.”

✨ When you use that level of clarity + empathy, John doesn’t hesitate.
